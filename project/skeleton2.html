    <p>I would like to start off by offering a few tips and tricks that I have taken with me through my cooking journey. I have so much to learn still, and I am still only cooking by myself in my college apartment, yet I do believe I have valuable tips!</p>
    <div><img src="tips.jpeg" alt="Tips"></div>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pinch, I believe that pre-cooked meals from Trader Joes are a life saver. They carry their own brand of multiple items, however, I would not shop here for weekly grocery needs.</li>
        <li>Looking at weekly circulars and becoming a preferred shopper/getting a membership to grocery stores in your area is a great way to save money. For example, I try not to buy too much red meat unless it is on sale, and then I will get a bunch to freeze for when I want to use it.</li>
        <li>Sauces are perfectly fine bottled and in glasses. Unless I am planning an exquisite dinner for my roommates, my college budget does not call for much more than market-brand sauces and dressings. Also, vegetables go amazing on pasta.</li>
        <li>Meal prep anything. If I have time to make pasta or rice as a part of my dinner, I will make a ton to save in Tupperware for my next meal. Between classes and work I do not always have time to boil water. A watched bot never boils.</li>
        <li>Air Fryers, Blenders, and Microwave ovens open so much possibility for quick and easy meals.</li>
        <li>Breakfast is incredibly important. I finally got off my practice of having a large cup of hot black coffee every morning. Ill get up a bit earlier than normal just to scramble some eggs; it feels amazing.</li>
     </ol>

     <h1>My Favorite Recipe</h1>
     <p>I want to share one of my favorite recipes of all time to make on a college budget. Steak and asparagus over rice. My boyfriend and I make this meal every time we get to see each other, and I have brought it to my life at school. This recipe is super quick and easy.</p>

                 <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees</li>
                 <li>Bring one cup of water to a boil, when boiling pour 1 cup of rice in, cool the burner down to a simmer and let sit until the rice has absorbed all of the water</li>
                 <li>Cover your asparagus in olive oil, then generously coat them in salt and pepper, followed by a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, onion powder, and garlic powder</li>
                 <li>When at 450, put the asparagus on an oven safe tray and into the oven for 12 minutes or until a golden-brown crust has begun to form</li>
                 <li>Heat a pan on oven-setting 5/6 (medium heat) until hot. Put 1 tablespoon of butter onto the pan until melted.</li>
                 <li>Once melted, place the sirloin onto the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let sit for 6/7 minutes depending on how red you enjoy the, middle, then flip and do the same for the other side.</li>
                 <li>If you are using the steak tips, sprinkle with salt and pepper and keep the tips active on the pan as they turn brown. After about 6/7 minutes the tips should be cooked thoroughly.</li>
                 <li>Once done, add another tablespoon of butter to the pan and begin to spoon the butter of the steak for a minute or two, allowing the steak to absorb some of the butter.</li>
                 <li>Once the rice has absorbed all of the water, add butter and salt to taste and put into a bowl.</li>
                 <li>Once the asparagus are ready, sprinkle with either fresh lemon juice or store brought and lay them over the rice.</li>
                 <li>Then, lay the finished beef sirloin over the rice and asparagus, add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
