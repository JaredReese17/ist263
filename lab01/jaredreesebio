    <body>
    My name is Jared Reese.
    I am currently majoring in Broadcast & Digital Journalism with a minor in the I-School with Information Management & Technology. Regarding my major, I have always had an interest in public communication and the news. 
    I am currently the Public Relations Chairman of both Phi Kappa Psi and Syracuse University’s Interfraternity Council. I work in SU’s Food Services.
    I am from Long Island, NY, and have three younger brother, which always makes school break fun. My favorite TV show as of late has been Avatar: The Last Airbender, and will hopefully soon be The Legend of Korra. I am currently reading The Rise of Kyoshi, an installment in the series that takes place before the TV series. Outside of work and school, I love to play volleyball and hang out with friends.
